### Code Institute - Milestone Project One: User Centric Frontend Development

For my project I decided to build a potential website for my brother's business, a private physiotherapy clinic. He currently has just a landing page and wanted to increase the business's online presence.
 
## UX

#### Project Objective

The business goal of the website is provide an increased presence online, similar or better than competitors, providing information to patients and potential attract new patients. 
 
#### User Stories

* As the business owner, I want to promote my business online so that I can attract new customers.
* As a user, I want to read about what treatments are available so I can decide if it's the correct treatment for my injury.
* As a user, I want to contact number for the clinic so that I can arrange an appointment.
* As a user, I want to send a query to the clinic to find out more information.
* As a user, I want more information on the location so I can easily find the clinic when visiting.
* As a user, I want to find out where the clinic is so I can plan where to park when visiting.
* As a user, I want to know about the physio's experience so I can decide if they are the right physio for me.
* As a user, I want to information on the classes offered so I can see if the time suit me.

#### Design Choices

I want the website to look professional and appropriate for type of business, i.e. medical type practice. I read about colour psychology and the preferences of different users for different types of websites and decided on a blue/white colour scheme with accent colours for callout/emphasis. I choose blue as its perceived as safe, dependable and trustworthy colour and is preferred by both men and women. The palette of colours used on the website including accent colours is outlined below.

In terms of the overall design, I wanted the website to feel modern but not overally stylised or minimalist. The cohort of the business client base is older so I wanted something easily accessible and readable with obvious call to action (i.e contact or email business). The initial wireframe for the home page is shown below and while the design evolved during detailed design I think it still gives a flavour of the final website. 

All wireframes created for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/allanahmurphy/AbbeyPhysio_MS1/wireframes). The wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## Features

#### Existing Features
Every page shares the same heaver, navbar and footer with the active tab changed to reflect the current page. The header and navbar are fixed to ensure visibility and easy navigation. There are callout buttons to the contact page in the header which disappear to save space on smaller screens. The navbar also collapses into hamburger menu on smaller screens. The navbar contains a dropdown menu to the subsections of the services page.

The footer contains 3 subsectiosn with details on opening hours, contact details and location. Contact details and location are key pieces of information to be made accessible to the user so link to each are included throughout the website. There is mini map in the footer which leads to google maps link also.

On the home page, index.html, there is a hero image with information box about current services during Covid-19 pandemic, this is important information currently so has pride of place. Below are three sub sections which lead to the other pages. 

The about.html page contains three subsections with the history of the practice and brief bio on the physio and personal trainer. 

The services page includes an overview of physiotreatments available and conditions treated, this is contained within a collapsable menu as to not have to much text unncessarily visible on the page. There is also a section on personal training and yoga/pilates with attracttive imagery with both. 

The contact page contains details of email and phone number and a contact for sending email queries. 

The location page includes an overview of directions a card with address, visible on larger devices, and a interactive google maps api with marker. 

#### Features to be Added

Because of my limited knowledge at the moment the contact form doesn't send any information, I'd like to connect this to the business email in the future. 

The 'Book Appointment' callout in the header also just leads to the contact page, ideally this will connect to an online booking system in the future.

## Testing

A summary files of all testing undertaken can be found here (to be updated!)

#### Browser Compatibility

The live website, hosted on gitpages, has been opened and tested on multiple browsers for responsives and intended appearance. Browers tested included:

* Google Chrome
* Opera
* Safari
* Microsoft Edge
* Internet Explorer
* Firefox

### Language Validation

Each seperate page of the website was ran through [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) & [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to find any errors. One error in relation to the use of a ref within a button was flagged. This was removed and placed in a div styled as a button instead. 

### Responsiveness

The website has been tested across multiple screen sizes using [Google Chrome developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) for a range of screen sizes including:

- iphone 5/SE,6,7,8, X and 6,7,8 plus for portrait and landscape.
- Moto G4 and Samsung Galaxy S5
- ipad and ipad pro
- varying laptop sizes and screen sizes using responsiveness tool on developer tools. 

The website was also opened and checked on Huaweu P10 and Samsung A20 mobile devices. 

### User experience & Usability

I also asked multiple users of different ages (family members) to open the devices on mobiles and laptop to sense check the layout, readability and usability of the site.
